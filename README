Here you can find a Dockerfile that can create a small docker image with Openjdk8 and Apache Ace.
To use this dockerfile :
First, build the dockerfile by running the following command : docker build -t "name-of-the-celix-image-builder" .
This will create a builder image of Apache Ace.

Then Run the following command : docker run -ti --privileged -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock name-of-the-celix-image-builder
This will launch the builder image of Apache Ace and create automatically the small image with Openjdk8 and Apache Ace in it. The image is about 110MB.

Finally you will have a docker image named ace.image on your host, you can check by running the following command : "docker images".

BE CAREFUL : 
	-You need to have the same docker version than there is in the image, in the image I'm using the latest version of docker by running the following command : wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh
	-In this dockerfile I'm building the 3 compact profiles of openjdk8 but I'm using only the compact profiles 2. You can change of compact profile by replacing "j2re-compact2-image" by "j2re-compact1-image" or "j2re-compact3-image" in thoe Dockerfile. 
	-The configuration file of Buildroot is dependent of the version of buildroot your using. If you want to change Buildroot version you have to create a new configuration file with the new Buildroot. Put it into a git reposirtory, and change the git repository in the Dockerfile.

If you want more information about the dockerfile, see the comments in the Dockerfile.
