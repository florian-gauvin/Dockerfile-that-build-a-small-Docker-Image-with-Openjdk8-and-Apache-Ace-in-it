Here you can find a Dockerfile that can create a small docker image with Openjdk8 and Apache Ace. This Dockerfile is useful for this INAETICS project.
To use this dockerfile :
Be sure to either uncomment the "ADD bundles /bundles" line in the Dockerfile, or map the "bundles" folder as a docker volume to /bundles when starting the container! 

First, build the dockerfile by running the following command : docker build -t "name-of-the-ace-image-builder" .
This will create a builder image of Apache Ace.

Then Run the following command : 
docker run -ti --privileged -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock name-of-the-celix-image-builder
This will launch the builder image of Apache Ace and create automatically the small image with Openjdk8 and
Apache Ace in it.

Finally you will have a docker image named inaetics/ace-agent on your host, you can check by running the following command :
"docker images"

BE CAREFUL : 
	-You need to have the same docker version than there is in the image, in the image I'm using the latest version
	of docker by running the following command : wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh
	-In this dockerfile I'm building the 3 compact profiles of openjdk8 but I'm using only the compact profiles 2.
	You can change of compact profile by replacing "j2re-compact2-image" by "j2re-compact1-image" or 
	"j2re-compact3-image" in the Dockerfile. For more information about the compact profiles,
	see this link : http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/161
	-The configuration file of Buildroot is dependent of the version of buildroot your using. If you want to 
	change Buildroot version you have to create a new configuration file with the new Buildroot. 
	Put it into a git reposirtory, and change the git repository in the Dockerfile.

If you want more information about the dockerfile, see the comments in the Dockerfile.

If you want to have the same image but faster, wihout all the steps, and a Dockerfile which size is lesser go here :
